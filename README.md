# Homework - Simple Classes

Create 3 single classes with methods to perform some functionality.

## MVP:

#### Calculator

    * Add :white_check_mark:
    * Subtract :white_check_mark:
    * Multiply :white_check_mark:
    * Divide :white_check_mark:

#### Water Bottle
* Create a water bottle class with a volume property. :white_check_mark:
* The volume should start at 100. :white_check_mark:
* Add a drink function that takes 10 from the volume each time it is called. :white_check_mark:
* Create an empty function that brings the volume down to 0. :white_check_mark:
* Create a fill function that fills the volume back to 100. :white_check_mark:

## Extension:

#### Printer

* Create a Printer class that has a property for number of sheets of paper left. :white_check_mark:
* Add a method to print that takes in a number of pages and number of copies. :white_check_mark:
* The print method will only run if the printer has enough paper. If it runs it will reduce the value of the paper left by number of copies * number of pages. :white_check_mark:
* Create a method to refill the printer paper. :white_check_mark:
* Add a toner volume property to the class. :white_check_mark:
* Modify the printer so that it reduces the toner by 1 for each page printed. :white_check_mark:
